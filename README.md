# Project Info

Snoezelen! Have you heard of it? It is a multisensory approach designed to gently and controlledly stimulate the senses, often used for individuals with developmental disorders, disabilities, or special needs. It typically takes place in a room equipped with soft lights, soothing sounds, and tactile objects, creating a relaxing and secure environment.

This project was done for a course at IMT Atlantique, France.
